## Prerequisites
- docker
- docker-compose
## Instructions

1. Move to ```form-api``` directory
2. Call ```docker-compose up -d --build```
3. Visit http://localhost:8000/ to use the GUI
4. Or visit  http://localhost:8000/graphql to use the Graphql interface 

## Comments
- For sake of simplicity I did not hide any "confidential" values
- The GUI has just the most basic functions without any concern for design
